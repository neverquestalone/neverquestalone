// Choosing and starting the app API the shell talks to (BUILD-PLAN "Desktop
// app" and "Contract: the app API the desktop shell calls"; PRD §11.2 SC-9).
//
// The assembly lives in the bridge: main imports bridge/byok/boot.mjs and calls
//   bootByok({ paths, platform, log, openExternal, importer })
// which loads <userData>/config.json, makes the key store ('os'), wraps fetch in
// the egress guard, takes the single-bridge lock, runs createBridge with
// createLocalBackend, starts the capture helper, and returns
//   { api, stop, bridge, backend, keystore, config }
// where api is createAppApi's (bridge/byok/app-api.mjs). Nothing else runs it:
// there is no headless bridge and no control pipe (systems plan D6). log comes
// from the shell.
//
// Where bridge code may be imported from (SC-9, TH22): a packaged app looks
// only inside app.asar (<appDir>/bridge/…), so OnlyLoadAppFromAsar and the
// asar integrity check cover every JavaScript module main runs; boot's own lazy
// imports (the capture helper's module) go through the same importer. Nothing
// beside the install folder (for a per-user NSIS install, a folder the player's
// account can write) is ever imported. An unpackaged run also looks in the repo.
// Not covered by the asar's hash: the keychain binding's native .node, which
// Electron can only load from app.asar.unpacked, and the capture helpers in
// Resources. On a signed Mac app the code signature (hardened runtime, library
// validation) covers them; on a per-user Windows or Linux install they can be
// replaced by the player's own account, which crosses no boundary there (that
// account can read its Credential Manager or Secret Service items anyway).
//
// Rules: the mock (src/mock-api.mjs, not in the package) is used only in an
// unpackaged run, when asked (NQA_MOCK_API=1) or when there is no boot.mjs
// yet; it is imported only then. The self-test runs on the real bridge. A packaged
// app without boot.mjs (a build that left bridge/ out), and a real module that
// fails to load or start, are error states the window shows, never a silent
// fall back to fake data where a saved key would go nowhere. Every contract
// call the module lacks answers { ok: false, error: 'unsupported' }.
//
// Capture (fork PRD §9.10, public PRD §11.1): boot starts the capture helper
// itself once there's a WoW folder with the addon; on macOS that's "NeverQuestAlone
// Capture.app", launched through LaunchServices so the Screen Recording grant
// belongs to it. A packaged app ships each OS's helper beside app.asar, in
// Resources (captureHelperPaths), since nothing can be run from inside an asar
// (scripts/fuses.cjs fails a build without it); a development run uses the
// repo's (boot's defaults). The Mac helper must satisfy a code requirement:
// the local identity, or a Developer ID team; a packaged app passes its own
// team (ownTeamId, read from its signature), so the helper electron-builder
// re-signed with the app's Developer ID passes on a player's Mac.
//
// The packaged --self-test runs the app on the real bridge from inside the asar
// (loadApi with selfTest, systems plan Batch 5): boot.mjs and everything it
// imports, in a sandbox with a memory key store, no WoW folder, no capture and
// no network (selfTestBootOptions; selfTestBridge boots the same sandbox alone).
//
// Main holds the real bridge through createLiveApi (fix-102): one boot at a time,
// never a stopped one. A boot stopped while no quit is committed (src/quit.mjs
// stops it only once a quit is) boots again at once, so the window can't talk
// to a bridge whose egress guard is gone, as it did on 2026-09-30.
