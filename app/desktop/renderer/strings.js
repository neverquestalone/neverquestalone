// NeverQuestAlone desktop app: the window's player-facing strings (the renderer's table).
//
// Source: the redesign's build spec (redesign v1, "the companion panel", 2026-09-30), §5 and §6,
// cleaned against docs/STYLE.md. English only (v1). The bar: brevity beats completeness. A screen
// has a title of a few words, at most one short line under it, and one primary button; anything
// that explains goes behind Show details (the sheet), scoped to the AI picked.
// index.html loads this before app.js; app.js reads window.BonesStrings by id and never builds a
// sentence from pieces (STYLE §12). Where these words and the spec's differ, these win: docs/STYLE.md
// governs the words (the key belongs to the AI company, never "your Claude key"; no "budget").
//
// Key kinds: title = a heading; headline = the first sentence of a result or card; lead, body, hint,
// detail = descriptions (whole sentences, ending with a period); line = other text; btn, *Btn = button
// labels (a STYLE §2.3 verb first); stillWaitingLink = a help link that is its question (STYLE §3);
// label, legend = a toggle's, switch's or field's name (a noun phrase); placeholder; chip = a status;
// alt = an image's text; aria* = accessible names; code = a command shown exactly as typed.
// Plurals are { one, other } objects, picked with Intl.PluralRules('en').
//
// Placeholders (filled with F.fill):
//   {name}       companion(), the companion's name ("NeverQuestAlone" unless renamed; STYLE §11)
//   {ai}         the AI's name: Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini; Other's service by its host
//   {co}         the AI company: Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Google; Other's service by its host
//   {host}       Other's service, by the host of its address (openrouter.ai, localhost:11434)
//   {model}      a model's display name; {app} a server on this computer, by its host
//   {masked}     a masked key, e.g. sk-ant-…A1b2; {prefix} the manifest's keyPrefix
//   {store}      F.storeText(): "your macOS Keychain" or "Windows Credential Manager"
//   {dayCost}    F.dayRange(priceHint.dayUsd), e.g. "$0.17–0.37" (information only)
//   {amount}, {limit}  dollar amounts through F.usdMicros; {count}, {pct} numbers
//   {time}, {date}  Intl.DateTimeFormat, local time; {pane} the Screen Recording pane's name
//   {loginPane}  the Login Items pane's name; {version} the app's version; {key} ⌘ or Ctrl
// {co} and {ai} never fill on the local path (Other at a server on this computer): its lines use {app}.
// No string starts with a ✓: the renderer draws the mark (an icon, aria-hidden) before a done line.
// Tokens: {os:…} and {game:…} are labels as the OS or the game shows them. The text in the braces is
// the English macOS or game label and is what shows in v1; common.osTokens gives the ones that differ
// on Windows. A …Win sibling holds a sentence that differs on Windows.
