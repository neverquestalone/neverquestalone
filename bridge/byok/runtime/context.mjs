//
// Game data is data (TH5): every game string is sanitized (sanitize.mjs), the block is JSON on one
// line with `<`, `>` and the line separators escaped, and its closing line carries a random id, so
// no game text can end the block or start a line of its own. The block is capped (10,000 characters
// encoded by default): linked tooltips, then the quests' objective texts, then memory, then the
// state's lists (the chains to start among them), where each quest's chain leads, the rest of the
// quests' detail and the context lines are cut first, and a note in
// game.notes says what was left out. Every quest in the log stays (PROTOCOL §2.6): its id, title and
// whether it's ready to turn in are never cut, and the first note says how many there are
// (questLogLine), so the model never takes the list for a cut one. For a local model (manifest.local)
// game text is also datamarked: every space in its strings becomes "ˆ" and the block says so
// ("datamark"), which the pack explains (spotlighting, [S155]).
// Other players' names from game data are pseudonymized (RT-12) in the block, the player's text and
// the history, unless the player opted in; the character's own name, realm and guild become "your
// character", "your realm" and "your guild" unless the player opted in to sending them (§13.1).
