// NeverQuestAlone desktop app: the main process's player-facing strings on the setup path
// (native dialogs, the tray, desktop notifications). Becomes app/desktop/src/strings.mjs.
//
// Source: the onboarding build spec (revision 2.11) §3.2, §3.4.3, §3.5, §3.7, §3.11, §3.12, §4 and
// §9.2, cleaned against docs/STYLE.md; where these words and the spec's differ, these win. English only (v1). Every
// dialog's text is built here from checked input and fixed tables (TH21), never from the page.
//
// Key kinds: message = a dialog's question (its title); detail, body = descriptions; okLabel,
// cancelLabel, *Label = button labels; title = a notification's or card's first sentence;
// headline = a result's first sentence; line, *State = a tray line or status.
// Placeholders are filled in main (template literals or a fill helper), with the same names as the
// renderer's table: {name} companion(), {ai}, {co}, {fromCo}, {model}, {masked}, {before} (today's
// limit, as {amount}), {store}
// (storeName(): "your macOS Keychain" or "Windows Credential Manager"), {testCost} (the key test's
// cost, "under $0.0001"), {amount} (a dollar amount, $2.00). A …Win sibling is the Windows sentence.
//
// A connect dialog's detail is three paragraphs joined by a blank line: {masked}, one of the body
// variants, then the terms paragraph (left out when the terms are recorded at the current version).
// The body variants are whole paragraphs, so no clause is spliced in (STYLE §12):
//   clipboard*   the key came from the clipboard, so it's cleared from there on success (T3)
//   *NoCredit    Anthropic and OpenAI, first key only, while SAVE_FIRST_KEY_WITHOUT_CREDIT (T1)
